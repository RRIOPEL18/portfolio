<p class="push-0">
This was released as a single titled 'What Do You Need', Axel was trying to attain an acoustic folk-like tone. The guitar was drawn by hand and made intentionally to look as if it was not done professionally, the battered guitar is a representation of obstacles overcome. This single can be found on Spotify and has been listened to thousands of times by people from all corners of the globe. It is also among my favorite projects because of its simplicity, yet despite the simplistic look it speaks wonders to Axel's style of music and brand.
