So I left him, saying to myself as I went away; Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows of anything truly beautiful and good, I am better off than he is, - for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows; I neither know nor think that I know. In this latter particular, then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him.
