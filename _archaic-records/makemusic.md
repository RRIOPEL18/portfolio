'If the Streets Could Make Music' was the first piece I did for Axel and is still one of my favorites. It illustrates the path to success if you will, the path in this case being that of a guitarist. I must credit my good friend [Aaron Sander](https://aaronsander.ca) for her help and mad photoshop skills.
