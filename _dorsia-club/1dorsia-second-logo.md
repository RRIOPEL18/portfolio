Sacred geometry is believed to be a mathematical algorithm; quantifying the visual simulation of all realities. Represented visually it is a collection of circular or linear patterns. "Sacred geometry may be understood as a worldview of pattern recognition, a complex system of religious symbols and structures involving space, time and form. According to this view the basic patterns of existence are perceived as sacred. By connecting with these, a believer contemplates the Great Mysteries, and the Great Design."<br>
