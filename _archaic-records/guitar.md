'What Do You Need'; Axel was trying to attain an acoustic folk-like tone with this single. The guitar was drawn by hand and looks unprofessional intentionally. This single can be found on Spotify and has been listened to thousands of times by people from all corners of the globe. It is also among my favorite projects because of its simplicity, despite the simple look it speaks wonders to Axel's style and brand.<br>
