'If the Streets Could Make Music' was the first piece I did for Axel and is still one of my favorites. It illustrates the path to success, the path in this case being that of a guitarist. I must credit my good friend <a href="https://aaronsander.ca"><b>Aaron Sander</b></a> for her help and mad photoshop skills.
