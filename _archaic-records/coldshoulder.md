'Cold Shoulder' is an early project designed to evoke dark emotions with blues undertones. The original photograph is not my work, it was taken in BC and then edited by me in photoshop. The scratchy font is used analogically and represents trying to escape our emotions; scratching away at fear in an attempt to become stronger.
