Pictured above is a version of what the final product with word-mark would look like. The font used is EB Garamond; used in most classic literature, and a symbol of sophistication. Below is the color palette chosen for the logo and brand identity. Browns color psychology is associated with nature, strength, and security. It is also representative of the coffee bean, and brown squirrel; seems pretty obvious?
